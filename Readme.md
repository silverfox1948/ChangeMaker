# ChangeMaker

## Purpose
This application was done as part of an interview process for a new job. The test was to create a small application that would count the different ways that change could be made for any given amount with a given set of denominations. Then explain how to use the program.

This application, and this readme.md file accomplish both part of the test. I actually put themm up here as an easy way to allow the interviewer/reviewer to accesss the code, but anyone else is free to use it for whatever legal purpose they may have.

## How to use the application
First, download and build it. It is built using VS 2017 Community Edition, so should work for most of the Visual Studio versions out in the wild.
As example, how many ways can 97 be constructed using the denominations of 2, 3, 7, 15?
The fact that these aren't "real" denominatins is immaterial.
